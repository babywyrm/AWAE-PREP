# /dev/random: Pipe

This challenge involves the exploitation of a PHP Object Injection vulnerability (which is why it's on the list). Pretty straight forward exploitation to get the initial shell, but priv escalation is a bit strange and In my opinion was harder.

## Personal Note

Weaponize the exploit from scratch! You may encounter something like this during the course, and you need to be ready to craft an exploit. I wrote the exploit in PHP, however it can be written in any language. Feel free to look over my exploit if you get stuck although it should be straight forward. Good luck!
