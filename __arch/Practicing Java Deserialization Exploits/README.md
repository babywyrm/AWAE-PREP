# Practicing Java Deserialization Exploits

For this tutorial we will attempt the exploitation of a deserialization bug. It's pretty striaght forward and also dives into the functionality of the payload. I went ahead and for the moment opted out of creating the payload to focus on other exploitation methods although I will be returning to the other links and learning payloads particularly the blind based payloads.
