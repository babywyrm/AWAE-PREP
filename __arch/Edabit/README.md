The AWAE syllabus appears to include many real world CVE's meaning we will likely be doing source code review, or chaining vulnerabilities in order to obtain code execution. Depending on the bug we may need to deploy custom payloads etc, so I decided to spend a week per language specifically Java, JavaScript, and PHP. Since I know Python I decided to skip it, however if you have little to no experience in Python I recommend spending a week on it as well.

It's important you are able to do the following in each language:
- Create a function
- Call a function
- Create a class
- Call a class
- Debug issues
